            <h3>Where Do We Sit?</h3>
            <p>
                Rise and shine! Today is the day we're going to Europe! Just me and my kids, I mean parents! Bags are packed to their full capacity and the excitement is escalating through the ceiling of the car as we drive to Tampa. 
                Welcome To MacDill Air Force Base! Yep, military base. There is no "airport" just the terminal. All the same experiences as a airport just on a very much smaller scale. We get our tickets, through security we go and then... we wait. 
                TWO HOUR LATER... Boarding time!!! We walked to the plane.  All I see is this huge dark green-greyish metal bird with it's back end open. "Oh, we enter in from the back...cool! But wait... where do we sit?!"
                The plane itself was hollow as a hollow tree. However, the plane was full of cargo and a military vehicle that looked like an oversized Hummer. I saw no seats though. Then my dad pointed out the stretcher-like seats that were attached to the walls of the plane. This is going to be a long ride, but hey it free!!! 
                "Just please God don't let this tank vechicle thing fall on us", I prayed.

            <h4>Just Leave Me Here</h4>
            <p>
                Food, food , food!! The food was so good!! Even the street food. Everything was made with great ingredients, heart and soul! I don't even like strawberry milkshakes but Germany made me swallow my words. 
                There was never a dull moment during our trip. Europe has everything! You'll never get bored! We saw castles, palaces, royal gardens, cathedrals that are now musuems, blue beaches, ancient ruins, the countryside, the mountains and the list goes on.  
                I didn't want to leave.

            <h5>Have We Learned Our Lesson?</h5>
            <p>
                One of my favorite, yet, saddest moments of our trip was visiting the concentration camps. One of the ones we went to was small, while the other one, called Dachau, is around 20 acres.
                It was such an experience to see it. In school, we read about it, but to see it first hand puts your mind perpective of what it must have been like. 
                The experience was a great reminder that everyone is different and different is good. Our history as the human race is full of lessons. May we always treat others as we would like to be treated despite our differences.
